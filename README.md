# YogaPulse

This is a web-based platform designed to connect students with yoga teachers and simplify course management for yoga centers. It supports three types of users — Students, Teachers, and Admins — each with specific roles and access.

This system aims to make learning and teaching yoga more organized, accessible, and efficient for everyone involved.
